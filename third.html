       <p>Call of Duty Mobile characters are quite numerous. At the moment, there are almost 130 of them. <br>
             These characters come from the various CoD games that have been released. </p>

        <h2><font color="red"><u> Guns</u></font></h2>
        <p>CoD Mobile has over 70 guns to use from previous CoD games <br>
        and we've gone through them all to try and decide which are perhaps <br>
        not as proficient in the art of killing, and which simply rule the game.</p>
